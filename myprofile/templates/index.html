  <h2 id = "hello">Hello everbody I hope you enjoy</h2>

  <p id="p2">My name is Leo Leal, and I'm from Granada Hills, California. But I lived most of my life in Sylmar, California and for those who think that's not much of a difference in location, trust me it is. I'm going to be attending the University of California, Irvine and studying to major in Computer Science and Engineering through their CSE program
     this fall. I used to play football until last year and recently took on a love for theater and acting, I love performing improv, and I also started drawing recently. I also love listening to music and watching anime. However, the one thing I loved most growing up was math and science, and until last year I thought I was going to major only in one or the other.
     But after discovering computer science through a presentation, given to the Calculus AB class I was in last year, I instantly fell in love with the concepts and possibilities brought into the light through computer science. Now after taking a computer science class offered by GHCHS, my school, I feel that I would love to strengthen my understanding
     of everything revolving around computer Science. I hope to use the skills I learn from CSSI and College to either, help create amazing Video games with graphics as amazing as Gears of War and Batman: the Arkham Series, my two favorite games, or work as a digital forensics expert and help with solving issues of the digital variety. </p>
